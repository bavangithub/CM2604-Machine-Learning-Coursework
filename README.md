This code is implementing a KNN classification algorithm on a dataset that contains information about emails (e.g., word frequency, character frequency, capital run length, etc.) and a target variable that indicates whether the email is spam or not.
The code first imports the necessary libraries for data analysis and machine learning, such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, sklearn, and matplotlib. It then loads the dataset using pandas and performs some initial exploratory data analysis, such as changing the column names, checking for duplicate and null values, and creating a heatmap to visualize the correlation between the features.
The code then preprocesses the data by dropping the duplicate rows, standardizing the input features, and removing the outliers using the z-score method. After that, it splits the data into training and testing sets with a 70/30 split ratio and calculates the optimal number of neighbors for KNN using the elbow method.
Finally, the code trains the KNN model with the optimal number of neighbors, makes predictions on the test set, and evaluates the model's performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. It also plots the confusion matrix to visualize the model's performance on the test set.
